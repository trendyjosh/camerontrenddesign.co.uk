                <p>Cameron initially started his career in horticulture working on a local vineyard in Kent. Whilst setting up his gardening and landscaping business, he then went on to study horticulture at Hadlow college. Once his gardening business reached its fifth year of trading, Cameron decided to pursue his lifelong dream of becoming a garden designer.</p>
                <p>In 2020, after graduating with a distinction from the prestigious Inchbald School of Garden Design, he set up his garden design practice.</p>
                <p>Whilst at Inchbald, Cameron developed his drawing skills and advanced his creative ability to implement visual ideas into gardens. Cameron tries to push the boundaries of the ‘norm’ and has become more aware of sustainability within gardens and how as a designer, he can become more thoughtful with how we treat the earth we live on.</p>
                <p>Alongside Cameron’s love of sketching, most of his inspiration comes from his practical roots as a gardener. Drawing plants, trees and landscapes has taught Cameron how natural structure - when assessed in detail, can be applied to almost anything design related.</p>
