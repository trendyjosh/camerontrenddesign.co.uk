He soon realised what I liked and I was included in the whole process of the design from start to finish and it changed regularly! I was shown many virtual images of the finished area until I was happy. He ordered quality plants and planted them when he said he would. They look good and I am looking forward to seeing them mature. I would highly recommend him."</p>
